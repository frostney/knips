# Architecture

## Executive Summary

- One binary: ScreenCaptureKit stream → complete-frame filter →
  AVAssetWriter input (hardware H.264) → `.mp4`/`.mov`. opname never
  touches pixels or NAL units; it moves sample buffers.
- The `SCStreamOutput` object the framework calls back into is a
  **runtime-built Objective-C class** — one plain `cdecl` Pascal routine
  registered with `class_addMethod` — so the build needs no linker flags
  ([ADR-0002](adr/0002-runtime-built-objc-classes.md)).
- Timing is taken from each sample buffer's presentation stamp; the
  writer's session starts at the first appended frame. This is what makes
  SCK's change-driven frame delivery record at real speed.
- Two threads: the main thread (run loop, signals, progress) and SCK's
  capture queue (sample delivery → append). No `cthreads`; shared counters
  sit under a pthread mutex; the capture path never raises or prints.
- Everything platform-neutral (option model, type encodings) is a unit
  with a co-located test that runs on Linux too.

## Units and layering

| Layer | Units | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI | `opname.pas` | lwpt `cli` package: `record`, `displays`, `windows`, `probe`; SIGINT/SIGTERM → `StopRequested` |
| Recording | `Opname.Recording` | Target → filter + geometry → writer → stream; progress; report |
| Capture | `Opname.Capture.ShareableContent`, `Opname.Capture.Stream` | SCShareableContent query (run-loop pumped); SCStream + runtime output object |
| Export | `Opname.Export.MovieWriter` | AVAssetWriter/Input bindings; session start; finish |
| ObjC | `Opname.ObjC.Runtime`, `Opname.ObjC.TypeEncoding` | Class assembly via libobjc; method type encodings (tested) |
| Options | `Opname.Options` | Neutral option model, validation, derived values (tested) |
| Vendored | `source/capture/*` | CoreMedia/CoreVideo/VideoToolbox/GCD, ScreenCaptureKit externals, pthread mutex |

Nothing above the capture layer knows about `objcclass`; nothing below
the recording layer knows about the CLI.

## The runtime-built output object

`Opname.Capture.Stream.EnsureStreamOutputClass` assembles
`OpnameStreamOutput` once per process:

1. `objc_allocateClassPair(NSObject, "OpnameStreamOutput", 0)`
2. `class_addIvar("opnameOwner", sizeof(Pointer))` — back-pointer to the
   owning `TScreenStream`
3. `class_addMethod("stream:didOutputSampleBuffer:ofType:",
   @StreamOutputSampleBuffer, "v@:@^vq")` — the encoding comes from
   `Opname.ObjC.TypeEncoding`, never a literal
4. `class_addProtocol(SCStreamOutput)` if the runtime has it registered
   (best effort — SCStream dispatches by selector)
5. `objc_registerClassPair`

Instances are made with `alloc`/`init` through a fixed-signature
`objc_msgSend` alias. Every method is a plain Pascal `cdecl` routine, so
FPC emits no Objective-C method-list metadata — the thing ld-prime
rejects.

## Threading model

- **Main thread** owns creation, start, stop, finish, and all output. It
  waits in `CFRunLoopRunInMode` slices so framework completion blocks
  (shareable-content query, start/stop capture, finish writing) can fire.
- **Capture queue** (`opname.capture.video`, created for the stream) runs
  `StreamOutputSampleBuffer` → `DeliverSample` → `OnSample` →
  `AppendVideoSample`. Rules on that path, carried from the prototype:
  no exceptions or `try..finally` (no `cthreads`, so the exception frame
  chain is process-global), no `WriteLn`, no managed-type writes outside
  `FLock`.
- **Why no cthreads:** the prototype documented cthreads' signal handler
  intercepting a benign SIGSEGV raised inside CoreMedia's XPC
  deserialisation of SCK sample buffers. lantaarn escaped it by not using
  SCK in the default build; opname needs SCK, so it keeps the prototype's
  shape: `cmem` (libc heap, thread-safe without a thread manager) first,
  real pthread mutexes, and `IsMultiThread := True` at startup so the
  RTL's refcount updates use locked instructions.
- Stop order is fixed: `TScreenStream.Stop` (waits for the framework's
  completion) *then* `TMovieWriter.Finish`, so no append can race the
  finish. The output object's owner ivar is cleared before the stream is
  released so a late callback finds `nil` and returns.

## Timing and the writer session

`AVAssetWriterInput.appendSampleBuffer:` uses the buffer's own PTS.
`TMovieWriter` calls `startSessionAtSourceTime:` with the first buffer's
PTS and records the last one; duration in the report is the difference.
SCK delivers frames when content changes (plus the configured minimum
interval), so idle stretches simply have fewer samples and the file plays
at real speed — the opposite of a frame-counting encoder.

Frames arriving while the input reports `isReadyForMoreMediaData ==
NO` are dropped and counted; that is the back-pressure path during
keyframe spikes, mirrored by the stream's `queueDepth`.

## Geometry

Display/window sizes from SCK are in points. `Scale` (auto = pixels ÷
points from `CGDisplayCopyDisplayMode`) converts to pixels;
`AlignDimension` rounds down to even, as H.264 needs. For a region,
`setSourceRect:` selects the points and the configured width/height is
the region in pixels with `scalesToFit` on. For a window,
`initWithDesktopIndependentWindow:` captures the window regardless of
what overlaps it; the output size is the window's frame at start, and
SCK scales later resizes into it.

## Errors and exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | ok |
| 1 | usage — options failed validation |
| 2 | failure — framework, permission, or writer error (message printed) |
| 3 | unsupported — not a macOS build |

A second Ctrl-C during finalisation calls `_exit(2)`; the file may be
unplayable, which is preferable to a corrupted writer state.
